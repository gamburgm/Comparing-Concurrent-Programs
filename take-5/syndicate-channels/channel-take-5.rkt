;; Authentication Manager Conversations
;; ------------------------------------
;; There is a conversation about registration.
;; Users register for a user account by sending a UserRegister message to the 
;; Authentication Manager, including the UserID of the User and the Channel on 
;; which to receive replies. The Authentication manager sends back a UserRegistered
;; message, containing the UserToken corresponding to the User that that User must
;; use to Log-in, and a new channel for all future communication.
;; 
;; There is a conversation about login.
;; Users send a Login message to the Authentication Manager containing their UserID
;; and their UserToken. If the UserToken correctly corresponds to the UserID, then the
;; Authentication Manager sends a CreateSession message to the Protected Component,
;; containing the UserID of the User logging in. The Protected Component sends back
;; a SessionCreated message, containing a Channel for communication with a User. The
;; Authentication Manager forwards this channel to the user in a UserLoggedIn message.

;; Lobby Conversations
;; -------------------
;; There is a conversation about the open Rooms in the Lobby.
;; To view the rooms that are available to join in the Lobby, a User sends a
;; UserListRooms message to the Lobby, containing the UserID of the User. The
;; Lobby responds with a Rooms message, containing a List of RoomIDs.
;;


;;
;; There are multiple conversations between Users and the Lobby.
;; To view rooms available to join in the Lobby, Users send a List Rooms message to
;; the Lobby, containing the channel on which to send replies. The Lobby responds
;; with a Rooms message, containing a list of unique Room IDs.
;; 
;; To view the results of games played by the User, the User sends a View Results
;; message to the Lobby, containing the channel to send replies on. The Lobby replies
;; with a Results message, containing a list of the Results of games played by the User.
;;
;; To create a room, Users send a Create Room message to the Lobby, containing
;; the User's channel. The Lobby creates a new Room component associated
;; with a unique ID, and the Room sends a NewRoom message to the client, containing
;; the ID of the Room and the channel of communication for the Room.
;; 
;; To join a room, Users send a Join Room message to the Lobby, containing the channel
;; of the User. The Lobby forwards the message to the Room, and the Room replies to
;; the User with a JoinedRoom message, containing the channel of the Room for communication.
;; The User is designated as the Guest.
;; 
;; To Log Out, Users send a Log Out message to the Lobby. The Lobby stops all future
;; communication with the User until they have logged back in via the Authentication
;; Manager.
;;
;; There are multiple conversations between the Room and its Host and Guests.
;; To cancel a game, the Host sends a Cancel Game message to the Room. The Room
;; sends a Cancelled Game message to the Host and Guests, and can no longer be
;; communicated with.
;;
;; To start a game, the Host sends a Start Game message to the Room. The Room
;; spawns a Dealer which sends a Started Game message to the Host and Guests.
;; Host and Guests are then designated as Players.
;;
;; A Guest may leave the game by sending a Leave Game message to the room.
;; They can no longer communicate with that Room unless they join it again.
;;
;; There are two conversations regarding playing the game:
;; To play a round of the game, the Dealer sends each Player a Round message
;; containing the Player's hand, the current rows, and a channel for posting
;; Move messages to. A Player makes a move by sending a Move message to that
;; channel, containing the PlayerID of the Player, the current round number, and
;; the card that the Player has selected from their hand to play.
;; The Dealer leads 10 rounds in sequence in this way.
;;
;; Rules/Assumptions for this conversation:
;; 1. Players only play cards in their Hand
;; 2. Players send Move messages with their own PlayerID only
;; 3. Players only send one Move message per round
;;
;; There is a conversation about the result of the game. Upon the conclusion of
;; the game, the Dealer sends a GameResult message to all Players and the Lobby.
;; The Dealer terminates and cannot be communicated with any further.

;; Conversations
;; There is a conversation about playing one round of the game. The Dealer starts a round
;; by sending each participating Player a Round message on the corresponding Player's
;; personal channel, containing the Player's hand, the current rows, and the a channel
;; provided by the Dealer for posting Move messages to. A Player makes a move by sending
;; a Move message to that channel, containing the PlayerID of the Player, the current
;; round number, and the card that the Player has selected from their hand to play.
;;
;; The Dealer leads 10 rounds, in sequence, in this way.
;;
;; Rules/Assumptions for this conversation:
;; 1. Players only play cards in their Hand
;; 2. Players send Move messages with their own PlayerID only
;; 3. Players only send one Move message per round
;; 
;; There is a conversation about the result of the game. The Game Observer observes a channel
;; for a DeclaredWinners message, containing the players from that game with the lowest scores,
;; indicating the end of and results for a game instance. The Dealer posts a DeclaredWinners message
;; to the channel that the Game Observer is listening to when the game instance ends.
