### Syndicate v. The World
1. The dataspace eliminates the need for configuration (e.g. don't need to wait for other actors/threads to send certain information to a manager, it just exists in the dataspace)

### Syndicate v. Channels
1. Synchronization occurs via channel-passing, so don't need to color everything w/region in the channels version

### Actors v. Channels
1. Don't have a dedicated channel for each conversation, just have a mailbox
