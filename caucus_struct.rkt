;; There are four actor roles:
;; - Caucus Leaders
;; - Candidates
;; - Voters
;; - Region Manager

;; There are two presence-oriented conversations:
;; Voters announce their presence through a Voter assertion
;; Candidates announce their presence through a Candidate assertion

;; There is a conversation about voting:

;; The Caucus Leader initiates a round of voting by making a Round assertion
;; with a new ID and the list of candidates still in the running. Voters vote in
;; a certain round by making a Vote assertion with the corresponding round ID,
;; their name, and the name of the candidate they are voting for.

;; There is an election results conversation, where the Caucus Leader announces
;; the winner with an Elected assertion

;; There is a conversation about the winner for a region. Each region is identified by
;; a name that voters explicitly register for. When a candidate is elected by a caucus,
;; they announce the election of that candidate and alert the region manager, who then
;; closes voting and declares a final winner when one of the candidates has received 
;; a plurality of the votes.

;; There are multiple bad actors.
;; - Stubborn Candidate: a candidate who tries to re-enter the race after having been dropped --> could be implemented differently than the way I have it now
;; - Greedy Voter: A voter that tries voting twice when possible.
;; - Stubborn Voter: A voter that always votes for the same candidate, even if that candidate isn't eligible.
;; - Late-Joining Voter: A voter who joins voting late (i.e. isn't available to vote for the first round).
;; - Unregistered Voter: A voter who votes without being registered to vote.
