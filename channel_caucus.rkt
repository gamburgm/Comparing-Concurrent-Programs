;;;; CONVERSATIONS ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Publish Conversations
;; 1. Candidates publish their information to the Candidate Registry through a `candidate` struct sent to the Registry's channel
;; 2. Voters publish their information to the Voter Registry through a `voter` struct sent to the Registry's channel
;; 3. Candidates can remove themselves from eligibility by sending a `drop-out` struct to the Candidate Registry
;;     -> This occurs when the candidate receives a number of votes below the candidate's threshold for staying in the race.
;; 4. Vote Leaders publish their information to the Region Manager through a `declare-leader` struct
;;
;; Subscribe Conversations
;; 1. Voters subscribe to the Candidate Registry to receive the most up-to-date list of available Candidates whenever a candidate registers.
;; 2. The Vote Leader subscribes to the Candidate Registry to receive the same information that voters do.
;; 
;; Message Conversations
;; 1. The Vote Leader sends a `request-msg` struct to the Voter Registry to receive the most up-to-date list of current voters.
;; 2. The Vote Leader sends a `request-msg` struct to the Candidate Registry to receive the most up-to-date list of available candidates.
;;
;; Voting Conversations
;; 1. The Voting Leader sends every Voter (through their `voter` struct) a request to vote through the `request-vote` struct, sending a List of valid candidate names.
;; 2. Voters reply by picking a name to vote for and sending the Vote Leader a `vote` struct.
;; 3. If one candidate has received a majority of votes, then that candidate is elected. If not, the least voted for candidate is removed, and voting begins again.
;; 4. At the end of every round of voting, the tally of votes is sent to every Candidate.
;; 5. When a candidate wins an election, the Vote Leader publishes that information to the Region Manager. When all caucuses have reported, the majority winner is elected.
